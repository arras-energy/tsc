   * [Pull requests](https://github.com/arras-energy/gridlabd/pulls)
      - 2 open PRs (next release 4.3.10) Behavior model, random utility model, and learning models not implemented yet but planning to implement by end of Summer
      - Current Release 4.3.9 includes fixes to pypower solver, add weather data to pypower module, add geodata support to pypower module, pole model fixes, update for Darwin 23 support, add human behavior module (04/18/2024)

      - PRs completed, will be added to 4.3.10
   * Press/Outreach
      - 45 minute lecture discussing the latest updates to the simulation tool, review some of the recent projects in which these capabilities have been employed, and present some of the results from these studies. Attendees will learn how to use Arras Energy and integrate it in their workflows through a variety of studies, starting with a simple local load modeling problems and a tariff design studies, through intermediate resilience analyses, up to geographically complex studies on large interconnections.(09/05/2024)
      - Will share slide deck next month to TSC
   * Active Work
      - Marimo tools development(on hold since February)
      -    No updates

      -    Pedram have created user ID and password for new users (TSC members)
      -    https://gridchat.gridlabd.us/
      -    Requesting members to try and give feedback to Pedram
      -    Manual sign-ups? Refer possible users Requires access code. Comfortable making this current iteration public
      -       Different access codes to see where users are signing up from
      -    Motion to approve public release of gridchat
      -       [x] Moved by Pedram, second by Allen, voted to adopt
      - DOE funding request of possibly $300,000 (TBA) 200k PNNL/100k SLAC

      -    mid-late August decision
      - Pole faulting problem
      -    Alyona is investigating further

      -    Currently can answer basic questions but struggles with more complex questions
      -    End goal for this application is for GLOW
      - API to pull object code to build/edit GLM code? Possibly a checker API. Could be a security issue and/or backfire
      -    Possible and good idea, but no staff has started working
      -    Security issues to code check/credential bypass
5. New topics
