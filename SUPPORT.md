Here are the ways to get help and/or lend a hand:

## General Software Usage

Browse the online documentation at https://docs.gridlabd.us/.  The answer to most software usage questions are found there. If the command you are looking for isn't listed or isn't described correctly/sufficiently, then you should probably [create a ticket]((https://github.com/arras-energy/gridlabd/issues/new/choose)).

## Starting a New project

One common technique for starting a new project is to find a validation test for your use-case. If you know which module you should be using, you can browse the modules for an `autotest` file that validates the system for your problem.  Test files are named `test_*.glm`, where the name corresponds to the validation use-case.  There are about 750 validation tests which cover just about every use-case imagined for HiPAS GridLAB-D.

## Reportiong Bugs

If a command is not working as expected or as documented, then you should [submit a new problem report](https://github.com/arras-energy/gridlabd/issues/new/choose) describing the problem. Be sure to search the [existing issues](https://github.com/arras-energy/gridlabd/issues) first to see whether it has already been reported. If not, please provide an explanation of how to repeat the problem with the simplest possible example you can come up with.

## Requesting Enhancements

If you need a new feature, then you should [submit a new enhancement request](https://github.com/arras-energy/gridlabd/issues/new/choose). Be sure to search the [existing issues](https://github.com/arras-energy/gridlabd/issues) first to see whether it has already been requested. If not, please provide as much information as you can about the purpose of the enhancement and how it might be implemented.
